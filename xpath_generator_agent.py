# Define the XPath generation prompt
XPATH_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
Generate the top 5 XPath expressions to locate a target element within the provided HTML context. Prioritize accuracy, robustness, and performance. Follow these guidelines meticulously:

**Input Processing and Contextual Understanding:**

1.  **HTML Snippet Analysis:**
    * Thoroughly parse the provided HTML snippet to understand the DOM structure, including parent-child relationships, sibling relationships, and attribute values.
    * Identify potential iframe elements and adjust XPath construction accordingly.
2.  **Target Element Description:**
    * Precisely interpret the target element's description, including its text content, attributes, and expected behavior.
    * Pay close attention to any specified states (e.g., visible, enabled, expanded, selected).
3.  **Page Context Awareness:**
    * Consider the broader page structure, if available, to ensure the generated XPath expressions are not overly specific to the provided snippet.
    * Analyze surrounding elements and their attributes to identify stable locators.
4.  **Attribute Reliability Assessment:**
    * Distinguish between static and dynamic attributes.
    * Prefer static attributes (e.g., `id`, `name`, `type`, `role`, `aria-*`) for robustness.
    * Use dynamic attributes only when explicitly specified as reliable or when no other stable locators are available.
5.  **Element State Handling:**
    * Incorporate state-aware predicates (e.g., `[@aria-expanded='true']`, `[@disabled='false']`, `[contains(@class, 'visible')]`) when the target element's state is relevant.
6.  **User Ranking Preferences:**
    * If specific ranking criteria are provided (e.g., prioritize `id`, minimize use of `contains()`), strictly adhere to them.

**XPath Construction and Output Format:**

1.  **XPath Expression Generation:**
    * Construct 5 distinct XPath expressions, each offering a unique approach to locating the target element.
    * Aim for diversity in XPath axes (e.g., `//`, `/`, `ancestor::`, `descendant::`, `following-sibling::`, `preceding-sibling::`).
    * Minimize the use of index-based selectors (`[n]`) due to their fragility.
    * Favor text-based selectors (`text()`, `contains(text(), '...')`) or structural selectors when attributes are unreliable.
    * Handle iframe cases by preceding the target xpath with the iframe xpath.
2.  **Output Format for Each XPath:**
    * "XPath: [The complete XPath expression]"
    * "Advantage: [A concise explanation of the expression's key strength (e.g., robustness, simplicity, performance)]"
    * "Disadvantage: [A brief description of the expression's potential weaknesses (e.g., fragility, performance overhead)]"
    * "Explanation: [A detailed explanation of the syntax and logic used in the XPath expression, including the chosen axes, predicates, and functions.]"

**XPath Construction Best Practices:**

* **Robustness:** Prioritize XPath expressions that are resilient to minor changes in the HTML structure.
* **Performance:** Consider the performance implications of different XPath approaches. Avoid overly complex expressions or those that traverse a large portion of the DOM.
* **Maintainability:** Aim for XPath expressions that are easy to understand and maintain.
* **Clarity:** Write clear and concise explanations for each XPath expression, making it easy to understand the logic behind it.
* **Specificity vs. Generality:** Find the balance of specific and general xpaths. Too specific, and small changes break it. Too general, and it grabs the wrong element.
* **Use of contains() and starts-with():** Use these functions when dealing with dynamic text or attribute values. But use them carefully.
* **Use of normalize-space():** Use this function when dealing with text that contains whitespace.

By adhering to these guidelines, you will generate XPath expressions that are accurate, robust, and efficient for locating target elements within the provided HTML context.
